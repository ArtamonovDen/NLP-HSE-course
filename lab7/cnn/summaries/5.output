Christopher Coke pleads guilty to racketeering and assault charges. His arrest and extradition to the U.S. was preceded by a horrific gun battle in Jamaica. Dozens of civilians were killed in the gun battle, which left Coke and his associates on the run. He was arrested and extradited to New York.In May 2010, a failed attempt to arrest Coke in Kingston, Jamaica's capital, sparked gun battles between security forces and his supporters. 76 people were killed, 73 of them civilians, in the gun battles, which ended with Coke's supporters fleeing the scene. Coke is still wanted in connection with the 2010 gun battles.
