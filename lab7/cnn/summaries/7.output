Roe v. Wade established a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. Abortion rights supporters and opponents hit the streets of the nation's capital Friday to mark the 37th anniversary of Roe v. Roe. The ruling was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973.A number of abortion rights supporters believe a bill passed by the House of Representatives in November does not do enough to provide access to reproductive services. Many abortion rights opponents say legislation approved by the Senate in December does not go far enough to ensure taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions.
