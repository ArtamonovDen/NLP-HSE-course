The battle in Washington over the budget is not mere partisan squabbling. What we are debating is the perennial argument between right and left. Do we as a society prefer to leave the well-being of our people to the indifference of the market economy, or do we believe that government also has an important role to play?"Big government" and labor unions also promote happiness for everyone, rich and poor, men and women, conservatives and liberals. All this remains true when controlling for the many other things that might also affect quality of life, such as income, age, gender, marital status, or their country's culture.
